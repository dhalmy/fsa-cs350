I have created a program that uses the code 850161 to unlock an imaginary lock and uses the code 850164 to lock this imaginary lock.
I've done this by creating an array of the codes that has an index pointer that increments every time the correct number is guessed, but resets back to index 0 if the incorrect number is given.
In practice, this works like an fsm. View drawing of the fsm by opening img.png.

This program can also 'crack' the code using the brute force crack() method that I coded.
This method calls the codeCrack() method however many times you want to see the code successfully crack and then displays statistics on the cracking algorithm.
I used python to create this program and while using it I have learned just how slow python is at tasks like these relative to compliled languages like Java or C.
I wrote this program im Python in order for it to run with ease when it came time for submission.
I didn't want to need to worry about if the code wouldn't build or compile right on another machine, so that was why I chose python over Java.
If I were to write this for the sake of efficiency or speed in the code, I would rewrite this program in Java or C.
